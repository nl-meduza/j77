If you're looking for forever,
I'll take the batteries out of my clocks.
So that we'll be stuck inside this moment,
as if time had really stopped.

I would tell you I love you every second,
except here, seconds do not exist.
So I'll say I love you with each breath,
with each smile, with each kiss.

And when I die, you can crank your watch,
restart your clocks, begin the time.
And know that we were infinite
in the moment that you were mine.
