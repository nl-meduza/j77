If you're looking for forever,<br/>
I'll take the batteries out of my clocks.<br/>
So that we'll be stuck inside this moment,<br/>
as if time had really stopped.<br/>

I would tell you I love you every second,<br/>
except here, seconds do not exist.<br/>
So I'll say I love you with each breath,<br/>
with each smile, with each kiss.<br/>

And when I die, you can crank your watch,<br/>
restart your clocks, begin the time.<br/>
And know that we were infinite<br/>
in the moment that you were mine.<br/>
